Minecraft SuperRender

Created: 18 OCT 2010
Author : Daniel M. Klein

Support platforms:
  - Cygwin
  - Mac OSX (Snow Leopard)

Goal:
  To provide an interactive tool to visualize mineral deposits in Minecraft,
  as bildzeitung is deeply troubled about his mining efficiency.

Features:
  - fast load
  - fast render
  - interactive, 3D viewing
  - 'you are here' marker
  - highlight mineral deposits (eg specific block types)

Future features:
  - cave locator and highlighter
 
Current thoughts:
  - slice-based rendering; convert vertical levels to 2D images and browse
    through those. Perhaps employ some sort of volumetric rendering
  - find ways to abuse threads and multiple processors, given the large #
    of data files the game uses
